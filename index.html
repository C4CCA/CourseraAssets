	<dt>1972 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement</dt>
	<dd>The Great Lakes Water quality Agreement commits US and Canada to &ldquo;restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Waters of the Great Lakes&rdquo;. Protecting and restoring the Great Lakes remains a significant challenge, but there have been significant improvements and regulatory changes as a result of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. For example, in the late 1960s, Lake Erie was pronounced as &ldquo;dead&rdquo; due to excessive nutrients and a lack of oxygen, and while hazardous algal blooms continue to effect Lake Erie, the overall health of the lake has dramatically improved.</dd>

	<dt>1991 Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement</dt>
	<dd>Signed in 1991, The Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement committed the two countries to significantly reducing emissions of pollutants that cause acid rain and contribute to smog.&rdquo; The emissions reductions related to this agreement led to lower levels of acid rain and ground level ozone, as well as decreased particulate matter. Some areas most affected, like Sudbury Ontario, have reduced their sulpher emissions to 1 percent of their historic highs.</dd>

	<dt>Adaptation</dt>
	<dd>Adaptation refers to adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects or impacts. It means altering our behaviour, systems, and ways of life to protect economies, communities, families, and the environment from the impacts of climate change. Adaptation happens at a variety of levels by individuals, communities, governments, and businesses. Adapatation plans depend on local risks, and varies greatly because not all are able to adapt equally. Examples include, protecting coastal regions from sea level rise, shifting or diversifying crops that can tolerate different environmental conditions, updating infrastructure and sewage systems to deal with increasing natural disasters, and migrating as individuals or groups.</dd>

The proclamation would include, but not be limited to, the following commitments: i. Repudiate concepts used to justify European sovereignty over Indigenous lands and peoples such as the Doctrine of Discovery and terra nullius. ii. Adopt and implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as the framework for reconciliation. iii. Renew or establish Treaty relationships based on principles of mutual recognition, mutual respect, and shared responsibility for maintaining those relationships into the future. iv.

	<dd>Production-based and consumption-based energy are terms that help us understand how energy footprints compare when we adjust for goods that we import from overseas. For example, a true accounting of a carbon footprint would include not only the energy needed for electricity, heating, and transportation, but also the energy needed to produce the goods that we buy. Any goods that are produced within a country are reported in energy use data, which makes sense if they are used locally. However, when goods are traded between companies, than the emissions accounting fails to capture the responsibility for emissions. Production-based energy use includes all of the emissions that we produce within a nation, including electricty, heating, transportation, and the energy needed to manufacture goods, regardless of whether they are used in the country or exported elsewhere. Consumption-based energy is an adjustment to Production-based energy use. To calculate it, take production-based energy use and subtract the energy used to produce things it exports, and add energy used to produce things it imports.</dd>

In a Euro-western context an ecosystem service is often defined as any &ldquo;service&rdquo; provided by an ecosystem usually for the benefit of people. But, if people are part of ecosystems, then they too can provide services to the Earth. To avoid a human-focus on this term, a better definition of ecosystem services might be anyway that ecosystems provide benefits to any and all creatures, the land, the water and the air.</dd>

El Ni&ntilde;o was recognized by fishers off the coast of Peru as the appearance of unusually warm water, decreased upwelling, decreased nutrients, decreased phytoplankton, and ultimately, reduced fish. El Ni&ntilde;o influences climate well beyond the eastern tropical ocean, causing warmer and dryer conditions in the US and Canada, and wetter periods in the US gulf coast.

For example, in the Arctic warming temperatures have led to melting of snow and ice, which reduces albedo. This results in less solar energy being reflected and more being absorbed, which leads to further warming. A negative feedback occurs when an initial change leads to a reduction of the initial change. For example, warming the oceans can lead to a reduction in thermohaline circulation, which causes less heat to be transported from the tropics to the poles. This results in a cooling of the poles, increased snow and ice cover and a reduction in warming.</dd>

So far, geoengineering is unproven on a large scale, and there are widespread concerns about side effects and unforeseen consequences. While the concerns are numerous, one major concern is that air pollution and ocean acidification will not be improved with geoengineering approaches. Another is that geoengineering approaches will reduce pressure on emissions reduction which exacerbates overall climate risks. Finally, the effects of geoengineering are generally temporary so they require continued intervention and the possibility of pausing interventions once started could wreak further havoc on the climate system. Each geoengineering approach contains additional risks, for example, injecting aerosols in our atmosphere could change the distribution of water on earth &ndash; something that is already under threat and critical to the current health and distribution of people and animals on earth.</dd>

	<dd>Called the Iroquois Confederacy by the French, and the League of Five Nations by the English, the confederacy is properly called the Haudenosaunee Confederacy meaning People of the long house. The confederacy was founded by the prophet known as the Peacemaker with the help of Aionwatha, more commonly known as Hiawatha. The exact date of the joining of the nations is unknown and said to be time immemorial making it one of the first and longest lasting participatory democracies in the world. The confederacy, made up of the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas was intended as a way to unite the nations and create a peaceful means of decision making. Through the confederacy, each of the nations of the Haudenosaunee are united by a common goal to live in harmony. Each nation maintains it own council with Chiefs chosen by the Clan Mother and deals with its own internal affairs but allows the Grand Council to deal with issues affecting the nations within the confederacy. The Haudenosaunee symbol of the long house, provided by the Peacemaker, is recognized in traditional geographic locations. Upon confederation each nation took on a role within the metaphorical longhouse with the Onondaga being the Keepers of the Fire. The Mohawk, Seneca and Onondaga acted as the Elder Brothers of the confederacy while the Cayuga and Oneida were the Younger Brothers within Grand Council. The main meeting place was and still exists today on Onondaga territory. Often described as the oldest, participatory democracy on Earth, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy&rsquo;s constitution is believed to be a model for the American Constitution. What makes it stand out as unique to other systems around the world is its blending of law and values. For the Haudenosaunee, law, society and nature are equal partners and each plays an important role.

	<dt>Indian Act</dt>
	<dd>The Indian Act is a Canadian federal law that governs in matters pertaining to Indian status, bands, and Indian reserves. Throughout history it has been highly invasive and paternalistic, as it authorizes the Canadian federal government to regulate and administer in the affairs and day-to-day lives of registered Indians and reserve communities. This authority has ranged from overarching political control, such as imposing governing structures on Aboriginal communities in the form of band councils, to control over the rights of Indians to practice their culture and traditions. The Indian Act has also enabled the government to determine the land base of these groups in the form of reserves, and even to define who qualifies as Indian in the form of Indian status.</dd>

	<dt>Indian Residential Schools</dt>
	<dd>The Indian Residential School system operated in Canada pre-Confederation until the final school was closed in 1996. The schools were run by various church sects, then later on behalf of the Canadian Government. It is estimated over 150 000 children attended these schools, with estimates as many as 30 000 children went missing or died while in the care of the schools. As well, students experienced many abuses, from sexual to mental, and were forced to speak English, and learn to live according to European values and colonial norms. The superintendent of the Department of Indian Affairs from 1913-1932, Duncan Campbell Scott, famously said &quot;&ldquo;I want to get rid of the Indian problem. [...] Our objective is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic and there is no Indian Question and no Indian Department.&rdquo; Since the TRC Report was released in 2015, it is accepted by the Canadian government, and public, that the schools wer e intended to systematically eliminate Indigenous Peoples and cultures.</dd>

Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this long-term temperature goal, countries aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century. The Paris Agreement is a landmark in the multilateral climate change process because, for the first time, a binding agreement brings all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects.</dd>

	<dt>Production-based energy</dt>
	<dd>&quot;Production-based and consumption-based energy are terms that help us understand how energy footprints compare when we adjust for goods that we import from overseas. For example, a true accounting of a carbon footprint would include not only the energy needed for electricity, heating, and transportation, but also the energy needed to produce the goods that we buy. Any goods that are produced within a country are reported in energy use data, which makes sense if they are used locally. However, when goods are traded between companies, than the emissions accounting fails to capture the responsibility for emissions. Production-based energy use includes all of the emissions that we produce within a nation, including electricty, heating, transportation, and the energy needed to manufacture goods, regardless of whether they are used in the country or exported elsewhere. Consumption-based energy is an adjustment to Production-based energy use. To calculate it, take production-based energy use and subtract the energy used to produce things it exports, and add energy used to produce things it imports.</dd>

Energy travels in the form of radiation: solar radiation entering the atmosphere from the sun, and infrared radiation exiting as heat.Radiative forcing is a concept used to quantify and compare drivers of change to Earth&#39;s energy balance. Radiative forcing is the change in energy flux in the atmosphere caused by natural or anthropogenic factors of climate change. It is measured in watts per meter squared. A positive radiative forcing means that Earth receives more incoming energy from the sun than it radiates to space - this leads to warming. A negative radiative forcing means that Earth loses more energy to space than it receives from the sun - this leads to Earth cooling. If radiative forcing is , it means that the planet is in radiative equilibrrium.</dd>

The pathways describe different climate futures, and are named for the radiative forcing values in the year 2100 &ndash; they are named RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5. For example, RCP2.6 models a climate future where the radiative forcing is 2.6 W/m2 in the year 2100 &ndash; a possible future resulting from rapid and aggressive mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. All 4 projections (and infinite possibilities in between) are considered possible, dependent on the volume of greenhouse gases emitted in the years to come. The IPCC 6th Assessment Report has added the use of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, which have differences but still use the numeric denotation describing the radiative forcing values in the year 2100.</dd>

	<dt>Tar sands</dt>
	<dd>Tar sands, oil sands, or bituminous sands are a type of petroleum deposit. They contain a mixture of sand, clay, and water, soaked with bitumen, a dense and viscous form of petroleum. In Canada, oil sands and their extraction are the largest contributor to Canada&rsquo;s increase in the greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 to 2017. Most of Canadian tar sands are in 3 major deposits in Northern Alberta. The environmental consequences of tar sands extraction are alarming. Oil sands extraction affects the land when bitumen is mined, the water resources required for separation of oil and sand, and the air due to the release of carbon dioxide and other emissions. Heavy metals are naturally present in oil sands and can be concentrated by the extraction process. Tailing ponds and disturbed lands scar the landscape of Alberta. As of 2013, about 715 square kilometers of land in the oil sands region of Alberta have been disturbed for extraction, while only 72 km of that land is under reclamation.</dd>

	<dt>Thermohaline circulation</dt>
	<dd>Thermohaline circulation describes the movement of deep-ocean currents due to differences in temperature and salinity in different regions of water. It is sometimes called the global ocean conveyor belt. To summarize thermohaline circulation, cold water is denser than warm water (4&deg;C is where water is densest), and saltier water is denser than fresh. Temperature and salinity change the density of water, resulting in the water to move accordingly. For example, in the North Atlantic, water is colder (due to latitude) and saltier (when ocean water freezes, salt is excluded from the ice). Colder and saltier water both increase water density, causing the water to sink. This process drives the deep and slow ocean currents.</dd>

Air pollution also contributes to the accumulation of nutrients, even in remote locations. Toxic algae blooms or harmful algae blooms occur because algae blooms in some cases produce toxins that make animals and people sick. Toxic algae blooms can occur in fresh and salt water. For example, toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie led the city of Toledo, Ohio, to shutdown their water supply for 500,000 people. Residents could not drink, or even touch their water, and boiling water was not an option, as it only served to release bacteria&rsquo;s toxins.</dd>

Treaty-making between Indigenous, as well as non-human Nations, occurred in what is now known as North America since time immemorial. These types of Treaties are diplomatic practices that include ceremonies, wampum exchange, and gatherings that renew the understanding of what an agreement signifies.&rdquo; What is an example of a treaty? &ldquo;In SW [Southwestern] Ontario, where Western University is located, the Dish with One Spoon is an agreement between the Anishinaabe &amp; Haudenosaunee to share this territory &amp; take care of the land not only out of respect for each other, but for all Peoples, the land itself &amp; future generations. When European Settlers agreed to Treaties in this area &ndash; Indigenous Peoples understood them as becoming a part of this agreement. Dish with One Spoon predates European colonization and was famously invoked at the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701.&rdquo; &ldquo;Treaties are not historical, inert documents &ndash; they are living agreements and invoke responsibilities from everyone living in Canada today. Settler Nations use Treaties to justify ongoing colonial occupation by interpreting them as land cessations. Indigenous Peoples of this land, who predate the settler state and colonial expansion, assert this is not the original intent and spirit of those Treaties, and continue the right to uphold their title, sovereignty and relationships to the land.&rdquo;</dd>

	<dd>&ldquo;We are all Treaty People&rdquo; emphasizes that all people in Canada have treaty rights and responsibilities. Treaties in Canada are between Indigenous peoples of North America and the Canadian government, the Crown. Treaties involve rights and responsibilities of Indigenous people, and of Treaty Settlers &ndash; those not Indigenous to North America but who have settled on this land and benefitted from caretaking by the land&rsquo;s original peoples. Karine Duhamel, Curator for Indigenous Rights at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, writes: &ldquo;Instead of simply seeing two parties at the Treaty negotiations, then, we should see three: First Nations, settlers, and the Creator. The Creator&rsquo;s laws framed First Nations&rsquo; understanding of and agreements to Treaty making. This kind of understanding is not a revision but rather a correction of a narrative written by non-Indigenous peoples that has failed to fully recognize the humanity of First Nation peoples and therefore their existence as nations with their own belief systems, ways of life, and governance structures. Treaty agreements are not for the history books alone. Today the principle of free, prior, and informed consent animates political and cultural debates about land, appropriation, and other pressing issues. This principle requires that the relationships pursued today engage First Nations perspectives and priorities meaningfully and with consent.&rdquo;</dd>
